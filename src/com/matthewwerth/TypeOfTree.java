//        Tree Type #1: Deciduous Trees
//        Also called hardwoods, these tree types typically shed their leaves in autumn
//        Deciduous trees have different-shaped leaves, depending on tree species; for example, star, heart and oval shapes
//        Examples: oak (Quercus spp.), elm (Ulmus spp.), maple (Acer spp.), willow (Salix spp.)
//
//        Tree Type #2: Coniferous Trees
//        Most of these are evergreens, which means you'll have greenery year-round on these tree types
//        Coniferous trees have leaves that are needle-shaped
//        Examples: pine (Pinus spp.), fir (Abies spp.), spruce (Picea spp.), cedar (Juniperus spp.)

//        Benefits of deciduous trees:

//        The same deciduous tree shades your house in the summer and lets sunlight filter through its bare branches to help warm your home in winter after it drops its leaves.
//        Other deciduous tree types can help feed your family. Plant fruit and nut trees for their bountiful harvests as well as their shade appeal.
//        Short on space? Unleash your creativity by pruning a fruit tree against a flat surface -- a technique called espaliering.
//        Benefits of coniferous trees:
//
//        Evergreen trees not only shade your home in the summer, but they also provide a wind screen to block harsh winter breezes.
//        Coniferous tree types provide a year-round privacy fence to block unwanted views. Simply space small trees according to the species recommendation so they'll form a green screen as they mature.
//        Birds seek refuge in evergreen trees, particularly during the winter. Learn what type of trees and plants attract hummingbirds in the spring.
